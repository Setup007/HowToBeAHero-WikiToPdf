  "readme": "# babybird\n[![NPM][NPM1]][NPM2]\n\n[![Build Status][1]][2] [![dependency status][3]][4] [![dev dependency status][5]][6]\n\nA very fast standards-compliant [ES2015] Promise library for node.\n\nThere are several fast promise implementations out there, like\n[`bluebird`], but they all add a bunch of stuff that's not in the\n[ES2015] Promise spec.  Further, as they've added more and more\nfeatures they've grown so complex that they can't be easily audited\nagainst the ES2015 spec (or the official `test262` test suite).\n\nThe `babybird` library is a stripped-down \"just ES2015\" Promise\nimplementation, which passes the Promises/A+ and `test262` test\nsuites.  It is very competitive with the performance of [`bluebird`],\nwithout having to give us standards compliance.  On the doxbee\nbenchmark running under node 5.1.0, `babybird` is 2.4 times faster\nthan native Promises, 4 times faster than the Promise implementation\nin [`core-js`], and almost 9 times faster than the Promise\nimplementation in [`es6-shim`].  The performance improvement is even\ngreater when running under node 0.10.\n\nFurther, `babybird` supports subclassing (as all ES2015 Promise\nimplementations ought).  This means that if you'd like additional\nbells and whistles on your Promises, you can add then via subclassing\nand without stomping on the global Promise.  In fact, the [`prfun`]\nlibrary provides much the same feature set as `bluebird`, but with a\nclean separation of concerns.  Further, `prfun` runs on top of *any*\nES2015-compliant Promise implementation, so if `babybird` is someday\nsupplanted, you can just swap out the core Promise implementation\nunderneath `prfun` without having to update any of your uses of the\ncore ES2015 or extended `prfun` API.\n\n## Usage\n```\nnpm install babybird\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar Promise = require('babybird');\n```\n\nThe `babybird` library plays very nicely with [`prfun`], if you'd like\na few bells and whistles with your library.  I recommend creating a\nnew module, named (say) `promise.js`, with the contents:\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = require('prfun/wrap')(require('babybird'));\n```\nand then using the wrapped promises this way:\n```javascript\nvar Promise = require('./promise.js');\n```\n\n## Benchmarks\nThese benchmarks are derived from the benchmarks included with\n`bluebird`.  A few of the bluebird test cases have been forked to\nadd \"fair\" versions, since bluebird obtained some of its speed by\nusing a faster `promisify` method than that provided to other\npromise implementations, and by using a few `bluebird`-specific\nAPIs which appeared to be tuned for the benchmark.\n\nYou can reproduce these results using `npm run bench`.\n\n### Node 0.10\n```\nresults for 20000 parallel executions, 1 ms per I/O op\n\nfile                                         time(ms)  slowdown  memory(MB)\ncallbacks-baseline.js                             819      0.48  32.99\npromises-bluebird.js                             1383      0.81  50.59\npromises-bluebird-fair.js                        1715      1.00  39.02\npromises-cscott-babybird-noall.js                1870      1.09  41.19\npromises-cscott-babybird.js                      1925      1.12  61.81\npromises-cscott-babybird-prfun.js                1991      1.16  48.60\npromises-then-promise-es6.js                     3084      1.80  64.54\npromises-then-promise.js                         3112      1.81  64.39\npromises-paulmillr-es6shim.js                   12475      7.27  94.20\npromises-zloirock-corejs.js                     18695     10.90  94.11\n\nPlatform info:\nLinux 4.2.0-1-amd64 ia32\nNode.JS 0.10.40\nV8 3.14.5.9\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU       L 640  @ 2.13GHz × 4\n```\n\n### Node 5.1.0\n```\nresults for 20000 parallel executions, 1 ms per I/O op\n\nfile                                         time(ms)  slowdown  memory(MB)\ncallbacks-baseline.js                             826      0.53  29.29\npromises-bluebird-generator.js                   1105      0.71  25.49\npromises-bluebird-generator-fair.js              1113      0.72  28.27\npromises-cscott-babybird-prfun-generator.js      1202      0.77  33.68\npromises-bluebird-fair.js                        1553      1.00  51.38\npromises-cscott-babybird-noall.js                1623      1.05  65.25\npromises-bluebird.js                             1643      1.06  43.66\npromises-cscott-babybird-prfun.js                1707      1.10  72.33\npromises-cscott-babybird.js                      1724      1.11  72.82\npromises-then-promise-es6.js                     2985      1.92  106.96\npromises-then-promise.js                         3004      1.93  106.69\npromises-ecmascript6-native.js                   3770      2.43  176.96\npromises-zloirock-corejs.js                      6298      4.06  155.89\npromises-paulmillr-es6shim.js                   13892      8.95  227.61\n\nPlatform info:\nLinux 4.2.0-1-amd64 ia32\nNode.JS 5.1.0\nV8 4.6.85.31\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU       L 640  @ 2.13GHz × 4\n```\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 C.
